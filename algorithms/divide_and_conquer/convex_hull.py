"""
The convex hull problem is problem of finding all the vertices of convex polygon, P of
a set of points in a plane such that all the points are either on the vertices of P or
inside P. TH convex hull problem has several applications in geometrical problems,
computer graphics and game development.

Two algorithms have been implemented for the convex hull problem here.
1. A brute-force algorithm which runs in O(n^3)
2. A divide-and-conquer algorithm which runs in O(n log(n))

There are other several other algorithms for the convex hull problem
which have not been implemented here, yet.
