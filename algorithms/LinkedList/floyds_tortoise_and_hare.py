# Floyd's Tortoise and Hare
[Reference : wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection)

## Description 
Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at 
different speeds. It is also called the "tortoise and the hare algorithm"

Checking the existence of the cycle in the linked-list. We can also find the node with which linked-list is linked
