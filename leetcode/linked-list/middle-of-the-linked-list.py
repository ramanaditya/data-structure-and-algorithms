### 876. [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

Note:
- The number of nodes in the given list will be between 1 and 100.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        count = 0
        head_ref = head
        while head != None:
            count += 1
            head = head.next
        count = int(count/2) + 1
        while count > 1:
            head_ref = head_ref.next
            count -= 1
        return head_ref
