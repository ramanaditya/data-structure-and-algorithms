Description
````````````

Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at
different speeds. It is also called the **tortoise and the hare algorithm**

Checking the existence of the cycle in the linked-list. We can also find the node with which linked-list is linked

Check For Cycle
..................

.. code-block:: python

        def check_cycle(self, head):
            """
            Return True is cycle is present else False
            :param head:
            :return:
            """
            # Two pointers
            tortoise, hare = head, head

            # Base Case
            while hare and hare.next:
                tortoise = tortoise.next
                hare = hare.next.next

                # Condition for cycle
                if tortoise == hare:
                    return True

            # Condition when there is no cycle
            return False

Get the Node where cycle exists
.................................

.. code-block:: python

    def cycle_node(self, head):
        """
        Finding the node where cycle exists
        :param head:
        :return:
        """
        # Two pointers
        tortoise, hare = head, head

        while True:
            # Condition when pointer reaches to end
            if not hare or not hare.next:
                return None

            tortoise = tortoise.next
            hare = hare.next.next

            if tortoise == hare:
                break

        # Iterating over the ll to find
        tortoise = head
        while tortoise != hare:
            tortoise = tortoise.next
            hare = hare.next

        # Returning node where cycle was found
        return tortoise
